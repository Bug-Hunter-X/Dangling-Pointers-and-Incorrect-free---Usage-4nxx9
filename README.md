This repository showcases a common C programming error involving the misuse of the `free()` function.  The example demonstrates attempting to free memory allocated on the stack, leading to undefined behavior. The solution provides a correct approach, highlighting the importance of only freeing memory obtained through functions like `malloc()`, `calloc()`, or `realloc()`.  Improper memory management can cause crashes, data corruption, and other significant issues.
